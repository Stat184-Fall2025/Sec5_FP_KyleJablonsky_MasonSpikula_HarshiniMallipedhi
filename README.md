# NHL Analytics: Identifying the Key Factors Behind Team Wins

This repository contains our NHL analytics project, where we analyze team statistics such as goal differential and shootout wins to determine which factors are most strongly associated with total wins. It includes cleaned datasets, visualizations, and statistical analyses used to support our findings.

## Overview

Using publicly available NHL team statistics, we examine the relationship between team performance metrics and overall success to better understand what drives winning outcomes in the league. Our analysis uses exploratory data analysis and visualization techniques to uncover patterns and relationships between on-ice performance and win totals, allowing us to identify which statistics appear to have the strongest connection to team success. Through this project, we aim not only to gain insights into the factors that separate top-performing teams from the rest of the league, but also to strengthen our skills in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and collaborative interpretation of real-world sports data.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.
