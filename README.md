# NHL Analytics: Identifying the Key Factors Behind Team Wins

This repository contains our NHL analytics project, where we analyze team statistics such as goal differential and shootout wins to determine which factors are most strongly associated with total wins. It includes cleaned datasets, visualizations, and statistical analyses used to support our findings.

## Overview

Using publicly available NHL team statistics, we examine the relationship between key performance metrics and overall team success. Our analysis focuses on how factors such as goal differential, shootout wins, goals for and against, and special-teams performance correlate with total wins, using visualizations and exploratory data analysis to highlight meaningful trends across teams.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

This is optional but highly recommended. You'll include one interesting insight from your project as part of the README. This insight is most effective when you include a visual. Keep in mind that this visual must be included as an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG, etc.). You can export plots created with `{ggplot2}` by using the function `ggsave`.
